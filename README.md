# Orchiestra Goleszyn
> Gatsby + GraphQL app for my orchiestra

## Only code
I share the project only for code because i can't share with you my api(graphCMS). 
However you could check this because:
* there i use here 'programmatically pages from data' (documentation: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/)
* I use node to take data and use them like templates for other pages.  
* I use sass
